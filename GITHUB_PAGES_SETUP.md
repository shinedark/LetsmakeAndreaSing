# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Correct Repository Setup

Your GitHub Pages deployment issue is due to URL formatting. Here's the correct setup:

### 1. Repository Name
- Must be: `gronkosky` (simple name, no spaces)
- Not: `claudio-y%20gornkonski` or similar

### 2. Correct GitHub Pages URL
Your site should be accessible at:
```
https://shinedark.github.io/gronkosky/
```

**NOT**: `https://shinedark.github.io/https:/claudio-y-%20gornkonski/`

### 3. Steps to Fix

1. **Check Repository Name**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - If the name has spaces or wrong characters, rename it to: `claudio-y-gornkonski`

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions" 
   - The workflow should deploy automatically

3. **Verify Build**:
   - Check the "Actions" tab for successful deployment
   - Look for green checkmarks on your commits

4. **Access Your Site**:
   - Visit: `https://shinedark.github.io/gronkosky/`
   - It may take 5-10 minutes for changes to appear

### 4. Troubleshooting

If still not working:
- Ensure the repository is public
- Check that `index.html` exists in the built files
- Verify the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

The app runs entirely in the browser, so no server is needed for GitHub Pages hosting.
